           <h3>How women were potrayed in the society</h3>
           
           <p>The author explains why Abel wanted a traditional  marriage with a traditional wife,according to our<br>
              traditional African societies it is believed thats women are supposed to be subordinate to their<br>
              husbands,Abel wanted a traditional woman that he can rule  over her because it is believed that the  <br>
              the traditional women were mostly illeterate and therefore they easily obey the norms and customs of tradition the way they are unlike the women like Trevoh's, thats<br>
              why the author  wondered  why Abel ended up marrying a woman like her mother who is  religious <br>
              and determined in her job and back to Tzaneen women are supposed to be submissive  to their<br>
               husbands and the way her mother always  explains about how men in Tzaneen wants women  who are subordinate to them.<br>

          <h5>Instances that Trevor Noah used humor in his life in the book Born a Crime </h5>
          <p>Noah explained how his father one day run away when they are in the park he calls him and his father panicked <br>
            and starts running away from him, in his mind he thought it is a game and he kept on chasing him not knowing the reason<br>
           why his father is running  away from him.<br>
           "We were in the park, he was walking a good bit away from us and I run after him screaming,"Daddy!Daddy!Daddy!"people<br>
            started looking.He panicked and run away.I thought it was a game I kept chasing him."<br>
            “I remembered my dad used to love running with me,” Noah said. “I used to remember running with him in the park and <br>
            running with him in the street. And then when I got older, and I realized about the laws in South Africa, he wasn’t<br>
             running with me, he was running from me. This was a man who couldn’t be seen with this child, because then the game<br>
              would be up, you know? The lie would be revealed</p>

        <p>when Trevor Noah's mother take him out she have to go with a woman name queen in their block to <br>
          act as the maid and Noah have behave like the woman is her mother in order to prevent her mother <br>
          from being arrested because the woman is a white colored skinned unlike her mother who is a black <br> 
          colored skinned therefore she is not suppose to walk with a white colored skin child due to the law of South Africa.<br>
        "queen would walk next to me and act like she was my mother, and my mother would walk afew steps behind, <br>
        like she was the maid working for the colored woman.When didn't have the colored woman to walk with us,<br>
        my mom would risk  walking with me on her own.She would hold my hand or carry me,but if the police showed<br>
        up she would have to dropme and pretend I wasn't hers,like I was a bag of weed."
      </p>
       
            <p>Back in Soweto they used to believe that God is a white man and He speaks english so if onces prays in english<br>
            God will answer her/his prayer first so Noah used to pray in english one day when he puts her shit in the rubbish bin<br>
          when they ask him to prayed because his family thought is a demon he refuses because he knows that he will be punished<br>
        he did not have another option he have to pray so that he will not be suspected that he is the one who did that<br>
      "Dear Lord,please protect us,um, you know,from whoeverdid this but,like we don't what excactly and maybe we should'nt <br>
      be quick to judge when we don't know the whole story and,I mean,of course you know best,Heavenly Father,but maybe<br>
      this time it wasn't a demon,because who can say for certain, so maybe cut whoever it was a break..." </p>

      <p>Trevor shows how humour heal her family when her mother was admitted in the hospital after being shot with Abel<br>
        of which he expected her mother to b in a serious pain instead she tells him that she is fine and no need for him to cry<br>
        “My mom looks at me and she goes, ‘Shhh, Trevor, shhh, don’t cry, baby.’ I say, ‘No, mom, <br>
        I’m gonna cry, you were shot in the head!’ ‘No, no no, look on the bright side.’ ‘What bright side?’<br>
         At least now, because of my nose, you’re officially the best-looking person in the family.’”</p>
